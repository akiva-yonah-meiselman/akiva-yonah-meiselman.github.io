I propose a hypothesis test for clustered samples. I derive my test by inverting the distribution of the test statistic under a standard assumption about the errors. This allows critical values to be selected from a distribution that matches the test statistic itself, which is crucial for a hypothesis test to reject true hypotheses at the correct rate. Largely due to critical value selection, previous tests can over- or under-reject in samples with few clusters, few ever-treated clusters, cluster size outliers, or treatment intensity outliers. I show that my proposed test is an exact test regardless of these features. I use Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate where this adjustment is most impactful in achieving exact tests compared to previous hypothesis tests, and I apply my test to an empirical setting from the literature.
